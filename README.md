# Random-ID

I read [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/omer-reuveni_adaadeacoacpacladg-acuacpacjacyabracgacpadfacp-activity-6947561029681766400-1Wye?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web), and loved the idea.
<br/>
It was an opportunity for me to create my first plugin.

The plugin produces random Israeli ID numbers.

The function for generating a random number was based on a code I had previously written to verify the validity of an ID number.

On occasion I might add a function to save the number history in [Storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/).
